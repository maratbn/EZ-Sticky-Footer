                          INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    (1) Test the plugin by opening 'example.html', and varying the height of
        the browser window.  The footer <div> should always be at the bottom
        of the page.  When there is not enough page content to meet the
        footer, the footer should still remain attached to the bottom of the
        browser viewport, and not be cut-off or require any scrolling to see
        it.

    (2) Upload all the plugin files to a web server.  Test 'example.html' on
        the server.  Use the example file as a template for deploying inside
        another page.

    (3) To deploy inside any webpage, it is necessary to load the
        'jquery.ez-sticky-footer.js' file after loading the main jQuery
        JavaScript file.  So insert a <script> tag for
        'jquery.ez-sticky-footer.js' below the <script> tag for jQuery.

    (4) The plugin requires that several <div>s (or any other tags that are
        displayed in block mode) be designated as:

            (1) Main page container <div>
            (2) The content expander <div>
            (3) The page footer <div>

        The <div>s are designated by assigning them special CSS class names
        according to the following table:

        role                            CSS class name to assign
        ----                            ------------------------
        page container                  jq-ez-sticky-footer-page-container
        content expander                jq-ez-sticky-footer-content-expander
        page footer                     jq-ez-sticky-footer-page-footer

        The structure of the page must be the following:

        <body>
          <div class='jq-ez-sticky-footer-page-container'>
            <div>your header (does not need any CSS class)</div>
            <div>
              ...
              your content (does not need any CSS class)
              ...
              <div class='jq-ez-sticky-footer-content-expander'></div>
            </div>
            <div class='jq-ez-sticky-footer-page-footer'>
              your footer
            </div>
          </div>
        </body>

        Assign the class names to the <div>s accordingly.

        Important:

            (1) The container <div> designated for use by the plugin should
                not have any customized margin or padding styles applied to
                it, as the plugin needs to manipulate these settings for it to
                work.  If needed by the page, these settings can still be
                specified in a nested <div>.
            (2) The expander <div> must be inside the page content <div>.
            (3) The expander <div> must be completely empty.

    (5) Test the page with the plugin deployed.  If the plugin does not seem
        to work correctly, please file a bug report at:

        https://github.com/maratbn/EZ-Sticky-Footer/issues

        When filing a bug report, please make sure to state the browser you're
        using, and to include links to 'example.html' on your webserver, as
        well as the page on which the plugin is deployed but does not seem to
        be working.
