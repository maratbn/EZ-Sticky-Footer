     jQuery plugin that provides an easy way to create a "sticky" page footer.

     "stuck") to the bottom of the browser viewport even when the browser
     viewport height exceeds the implicit height of the page content.

    JavaScript-based solution for a non-trival CSS problem.

        * No numeric configuration with dynamically-changing and arbitrary
          footer / content areas heights.

        * No absolute or relative positioning.

        * No other funky CSS tricks and hacks, in fact no CSS required.

        * Works on IE6+.

        * Works on the default Android Browser.


    The plugin requires that 3 special <div>s (or any other tags that are
    displayed in block mode) be designated as:

        (1) Main page container <div>
        (2) The content expander <div>
        (3) The page footer <div>

    The <div>s are designated by assigning them special CSS class names
    according to the following table:

    role                            CSS class name to assign
    ----                            ------------------------
    page container                  jq-ez-sticky-footer-page-container
    content expander                jq-ez-sticky-footer-content-expander
    page footer                     jq-ez-sticky-footer-page-footer

    The structure of the page must be the following:

    <body>
      <div class='jq-ez-sticky-footer-page-container'>
        <div>your header (does not need any CSS class)</div>
        <div>
          ...
          your content (does not need any CSS class)
          ...
          <div class='jq-ez-sticky-footer-content-expander'></div>
        </div>
        <div class='jq-ez-sticky-footer-page-footer'>
          your footer
        </div>
      </div>
    </body>

    Important:

        (1) The container <div> designated for use by the plugin should
            not have any customized margin or padding styles applied to
            it, as the plugin needs to manipulate these settings for it to
            work.  If needed by the page, these settings can still be
            specified in a nested <div>.
        (2) The expander <div> must be inside the page content <div>.
        (3) The expander <div> must be completely empty.
